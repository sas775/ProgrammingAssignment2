## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special “matrix”, which is really a list containing a function to:

## set the value of the matrix,get the value of the matrix,set the value of the inverse,get the value of the inverse


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
          x <<- y
          m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set,
       get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}

## this function computes the inverse of the special “matrix” returned by makeCacheMatrix above
## if the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if (!is.null(m)) {
          message("getting cached data")
          return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
## For this assignment, we have assumed that the matrix supplied is always invertible.
