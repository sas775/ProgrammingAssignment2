Project Overview
This project aims to predict the rental costs of properties in Bangladesh based on various features such as location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, area in square feet, and the date of the data update. The goal is to provide an accurate prediction model that can assist potential tenants and landlords in estimating rental prices more effectively.

Features
The dataset includes the following features:

Location: The geographical location of the property.
Number of Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the property.
Number of Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the property.
Area in Square Feet: The total area of the property.
Date of Data Update: The date when the rental data was last updated.

Model
I utilized the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression algorithm for this prediction task. KNN is a simple, yet effective machine learning algorithm that predicts the value of a target variable based on the average value of its nearest neighbors. This approach is particularly useful for regression tasks where the relationship between features and the target variable is complex and non-linear.
